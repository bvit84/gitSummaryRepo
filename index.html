            Version Control System (VCS) or Source Code Manager (SCM): A VCS allows you to:
            revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state,
            review changes made over time, see who last modified something that might be causing
            a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more.

                    The git status is our key to the mind of Git. It will tell us what Git 
                    is thinking and the state of our repository as Git sees it. When you're 
                    first starting out, you should be using the git status command all of 
                    the time! You should get into the habit of running it after any other 
                    command. This will help you learn how Git works and it'll help you 
                    from making (possibly) incorrect assumptions about the state of your 
                    files/repository.

                            be different for other repositories that have 
                            multiple people collaborating together, but for 
                            this one, there's only one person making all of 
                            the commits, so the commit author will be

                    When git pull is run, the following things happen:<br>
                    * the commit(s) on the remote branch are copied to the 
                    local repository<br>

                    * the local tracking branch (origin/master) is merged into the 
                    local branch (master).

                    it does not automatically merge the local branch with the remote 
                    tracking branch after those commits have been received.<br>
                    One main point when you want to use git fetch rather than git pull 
                    is if your remote branch and your local branch both have changes 
                    that neither of the other ones has. In this case, you want to fetch 
                    the remote changes to get them in your local branch and then 
                    perform a merge manually. Then you can push that new merge commit 
                    back to the remote.
